# # You are given an array A of n integers and q queries. Each query can be of one of the following two types:
# Update the array from index l to r (both inclusive) as follows:

# Copy
# Edit
# A[i] = (i - l + 1) * A[i]
# Where i ranges from l to r.

# ðŸ”¹ Type 2 Query: (2, l, r)
# Calculate the sum of elements from index l to r (both inclusive), and add it to the final answer.

# ðŸ”¸ Final Output
# After processing all queries, print the sum of results of all type 2 queries modulo (10^9 + 7).
